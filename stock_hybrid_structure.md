## 3. Combined System Dynamics

| Layer | Legal Form | Core (10%) | Stock Layer (90%) | Risk Level |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 5-person circle | Informal P2P | Rotates cash | Each owns stock in brokerage | Low-medium, local |
| 100-person rental pool | LLC / REIT | Monthly rent | LLC invests in stocks | Medium-high, regulated |

**Notes:**
- 10% core keeps stability even if 90% stock layer fluctuates.
- Written agreements and transparency protect against legal disputes.
- Tax compliance is critical for stock gains and rental income.

---

**Bottom Line:**
- Small circles: Keep informal, voluntary, interest-free; track stock ownership individually.
- Large pools: Form LLC/REIT, follow SEC and state regulations, disclose all risks.
- System: Hybrid structure allows high-growth stock layer with a stable core, fully legal if structured as above.
